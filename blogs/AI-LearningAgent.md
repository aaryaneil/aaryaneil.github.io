### **Project Showcase: Adaptive AI Tutor (Gemini Learning Agent)**

#### **Introduction**

The future of education lies in personalized learning experiences that adapt to individual needs and paces. This project explores that future by leveraging the power of large language models to create a bespoke learning assistant. Developed as an assignment for my Machine Learning course with Dr. Sandra Metzger, this "Adaptive AI Tutor" is a custom agent built on the Gemini platform, designed to transform any document or video into an interactive educational module.

#### **Description of the Artifact**

The artifact is a custom learning agent, or "Gem," configured within the Gemini ecosystem. It is designed to act as a personal Socratic coach for any given subject matter provided by the user. Its core functionalities include:

* **Source Material Ingestion:** The agent takes a specific document (.pdf, .txt) or video (via transcript) as its foundational knowledge base.
* **Interactive Quizzing:** Based on the provided content, the agent can generate relevant questions to test the user's comprehension and recall.
* **In-Depth Explanations:** The agent can elaborate on complex topics found within the material, breaking them down into simpler, more understandable concepts.
* **Contextual Q&A:** The agent can answer specific questions from the user, ensuring its responses are grounded exclusively in the context of the provided document or video.

#### **Objective**

The primary academic objective was to understand the architecture and mechanics of creating custom, task-specific AI agents. The project aimed to provide hands-on experience with the Gemini platform and, most importantly, to develop a deep appreciation for the critical role of prompt engineering in shaping an agent's behavior, personality, and capabilities. The goal was to successfully create an agent that was not just a passive information retriever, but an active, engaging learning partner.

#### **Process**

1.  **Persona Definition:** The first step was to define the agent's core identity. I crafted a persona for an encouraging and knowledgeable "AI Coach" whose goal is to help the user master the subject matter.
2.  **System Prompt Engineering:** This was the most critical phase. I engineered a detailed system prompt that instructed the agent on its role, tone, and operational constraints. This included rules for sticking strictly to the source material (preventing hallucination), methods for formulating effective questions, and guidelines for providing clear, layered explanations.
3.  **Knowledge Configuration:** I configured the agent's ability to accept and process files, effectively creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system where the provided document serves as the "retrieval" source.
4.  **Capability Scaffolding:** I defined the agent's primary functions (quiz, explain, answer) through carefully worded instructions and example interactions, guiding the model on how to best execute each task.
5.  **Iterative Testing & Refinement:** I tested the agent with various sample materials—from technical papers to historical articles—and continuously refined the prompts based on the quality of its responses, improving its accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness.

#### **Tools and Technologies**

* **Platform:** Google AI Studio / Gemini Platform ("Gem Manager")
* **Core Model:** Gemini Foundation Model
* **Key Methodologies:** Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* **Input Formats:** Document files (.pdf, .txt), Video Transcripts

#### **Value Proposition**

This project demonstrates a strong, practical understanding of how to customize foundation models for specialized, high-value applications. It showcases the ability to move beyond basic API calls and architect a nuanced AI agent with a specific purpose and personality.

* **Unique Value:** The project's uniqueness lies in its focus on pedagogy. Instead of creating a simple Q&A bot, I engineered a learning coach that employs Socratic methods to enhance user understanding. This required a sophisticated approach to prompt design, highlighting my ability to control and direct LLM behavior to achieve a complex goal.
* **Relevance:** As of August 2025, the ability to create custom, purpose-built AI agents is one of the most in-demand skills in the technology industry. This project is a direct and concrete example of that skill, particularly relevant to the burgeoning EdTech sector. It proves my hands-on capability in prompt engineering and my understanding of how to build safe, effective, and context-aware AI tools.
