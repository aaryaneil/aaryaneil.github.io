Today I created an application which acted as a learning agent in the Gemini Gem Manager. It was part of an assignment from my professor for my Machine Learning class, Dr. Sandra Metzger. This learning agent is able to take a document or video as input and then act as a coach for you. The agent is able to quiz you on the given topic, explain the topic in-depth and answer your question regarding the topic.

This exercise enabled me to understand how to create my own GPTs and understanding the importance Prompt Engineering in designing custom GPTs.
