Last week I was part of OSS4AI hackathon and I was tasked at developing an AI agent that helped people with their day-to-day tasks the AI agent was similar to the one I created for my JARVIS project but I thought about tweaking the code more to give it access to a variety of functionalities. I gave the agent access to my Google Docs and Calendar so that it could help me in organizing my day and created documents in Google Docs.

Even though we didn't win the hackathon but it was a great learning experience and I was able to code quickly and efficiently was able to deliver good quality code in the given time period.
