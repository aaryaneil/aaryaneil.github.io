# **Timeline of Artificial Intelligence**

## **Before 1950 – Foundations**
- **Ancient Times**: Myths of mechanical men (e.g., Greek Talos, Jewish Golem).
- **1642**: Blaise Pascal creates the first mechanical calculator.
- **1837**: Charles Babbage conceptualizes the Analytical Engine.
- **1854**: George Boole develops Boolean algebra — essential for binary computing.
- **1936**: Alan Turing proposes the Turing Machine, laying groundwork for modern computing.

## **1950s – Birth of AI**
- **1950**: Alan Turing publishes “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, introducing the Turing Test.
- **1951**: Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds develop the first artificial neural network (SNARC).
- **1952**: Arthur Samuel develops the first self-learning game program (Checkers).
- **1956**: Term “Artificial Intelligence” coined at the Dartmouth Conference (John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon).
- **1958**:
  - John McCarthy develops LISP, the first AI programming language.
  - Frank Rosenblatt develops the perceptron, an early ANN.
- **1959**: Arthur Samuel coins the term "machine learning".

## **1960s – Early Exploration**
- **1961**: First industrial robot, Unimate, used in a GM factory.
- **1966**: ELIZA, an early natural language processing chatbot, is developed.
- **1969**: Shakey the Robot — first robot that can reason about its actions.

## **1970s – First AI Winter**
- AI research overpromised and underdelivered; funding cuts followed.
- Rule-based systems struggled with real-world complexity.

## **1980s – Expert Systems Boom**
- **1980s**: Expert systems like XCON used for business applications.
- **1987–1993**: Second AI Winter due to collapse of expert systems market and limited computing power.

## **1990s – Machine Learning Emerges**
- **1997**: IBM’s Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
- Emergence of statistical machine learning methods (e.g., SVMs, decision trees).

## **2000s – Data & Internet Era**
- Explosion of data and computing power.
- **2002**: First commercially available robotic vacuum, Roomba.
- **2006**: Geoffrey Hinton popularizes deep learning.

## **2010s – Deep Learning Revolution**
- **2011**: IBM’s Watson wins Jeopardy.
- **2012**: AlexNet wins ImageNet competition — major deep learning breakthrough.
- **2014**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) introduced.
- **2016**: Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeats world champion Lee Sedol in Go.

## **2020s – Generative AI & Foundation Models**
- **2020**: OpenAI releases GPT-3, a massive language model.
- **2021**: GitHub Copilot released using Codex.
- **2022**: ChatGPT launches, sparking public AI adoption.
- **2023**: GPT-4 released with multimodal (text + image) capabilities.
- **2024**: Explosion of AI agents, video models (e.g., Sora), and open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma).

## **Future – What’s Next?**
- General AI (AGI) development.
