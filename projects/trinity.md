Trinity Hotels is a web application that I helped create as a team project in CMPE 202, Spring 2022. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

Trinity is implemented using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of functionalities like creating and managing hotels and reservations.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [React](https://react.dev) Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
